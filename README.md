Software Development Second Term Project 

Overview:  
Tinder meets linkedin. A swipe based website that allows individuals to meet each other in a professional manner whether it be for a job interview or a mentor/mentee relationship. Our website will pair every mentee with a mentor and vice versa once per day. If the two both decide that itâ€™s worth it to contact each other, a chat box will be created with the two of them. Matches will be based off similar professional interests and location. For example, if a mentee is interested in connecting with a software engineer and a mentor has developed at google for 5 years, they could be matched.
