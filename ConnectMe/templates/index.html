		 <b>Welcome to Connect Me</b><br><br>
		 Inspired by Tinder and LinkedIn, team Billionaires Boys Club has decided to create Connect Me.
		 <br><br>
		 This swipe based website allows individuals to meet each other in a professional manner, whether it be for a job interview, a mentor/mentee relationship,
		 or just getting to know other people who may share similar interests as you!
		  Our website will pair every person who decides to swipe right on each other.
			If the two both decide that itâ€™s worth it to contact each other, a chat box will be created with the two of them.
			<br>
			<br>
		 Matches will be based off similar professional interests and location.
		 For example, if a mentee is interested in connecting with a software engineer and a mentor has developed at google for 5 years, they could be matched.
		 <br><br>
		 Start off by creating an account by registering. When you log in with <b>your email as the username</b>, you will be shown all the profiles you can swipe right or left on.
		 On each profile, it will display the person's information including name, email, interest, and a short biography. You can then message
		 the people you match with.
